# Agile Avengers - Holistic Tracking App

- **Our Problem**: Bootcampers are disengaged with the current holistic documentation experience because google forms are not engaging, bootcampers don’t understand the value of documenting their SoC experience, or what happens to their reflections with no access to it when it’s sent.

- **Solution**: A storyboard where bootcampers can record their experiences and how they are feeling in a fun and engaging way. Bootcampers will be able to view their posts allowing them to be reflective, monitor their moods and celebrate their achievements. This will be a mobile app - PWA - bootcampers can use their phones rather than their laptop.
